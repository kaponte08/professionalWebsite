                            In my first year, I was also a part of 
                            the Restorative Justice Action Team in 
                            which we would have bi-weekly meetings 
                            with school staff to express and discuss 
                            concerns students have and how to deal 
                            with them. Unfortunately this position 
                            was dissolved as school staff and RJAT 
                            schedules conflicted. We are however 
                            bringing it back.<br><br>
                            As a RJ, we aim to help develop a 
                            community within our school and to 
                            help repair any harm done in conflicts
                            & relationships.

                            I’ve been placed in a leadership role 
                            to oversee the progress being made 
                            regarding game projects. I act as a 
                            sort of translator between my team 
                            members and our mentors, but also 
                            for each other. I send reminders/
                            announcements twice a week to keep 
                            everyone updated on what’s to be worked 
                            and what they might’ve missed from the 
                            last time they were present. I also have 
                            to keep in mind everyone’s schedule and 
                            how much they are able to put into our 
                            game without sacrificing anything. <br><br>
                            Team members also rely on me to run through 
                            their code/work and to find any mistakes. 
                            Also responsible for finding alternatives 
                            if we’re unable to get something done, such 
                            as finding free-to-use assets to use if we’re 
                            unable to make them ourselves in time.

                                Picking up and taking care of my
                                younger brother ever since 5th grade. 
                                Taking care of him has allowed me to 
                                become more aware of other’s sensitivities. 
                                Occasionally, I’m tasked with looking after 
                                my cousins. 
                                Through babysitting, it has allowed me to be 
                                able to work well with kids.  Not only that 
                                but other people, one would be surprised on 
                                how <i>similar a 50 year old and a 5 year old

                                    We had been tasked with finding a 
                                    solution to any user issue found on 
                                    the Warby Parker website that helped 
                                    connect the in-store shopping experience
                                    as well as the online shopping experience. 
                                    Throughout the weeks, me and my team 
                                    learned the thought process behind the 
                                    companies as well as how to make prototypes 
                                    through Adobe XD.
